## Global Tech Layoffs Analysis (2020-2024)
**Repository**
https://github.com/Esub-88/tech-layoffs-2020-2024

**Tools Used:**  
- SQL Server (T-SQL): data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory queries  
- Power BI: interactive dashboard design  
- Excel: dataset inspection and export  
- GitHub: version control, documentation

**Project Overview:**  
This project analyzes global tech layoffs from 2020–2024 to uncover trends in:  
- Industry-level impacts  
- Company-level layoff events  
- Year-over-year workforce reductions  
- Severity of layoffs as % of workforce  
- Relationship between funding raised and layoffs  
- Country and industry slice-and-dice filtering

The dashboard includes:  
- KPIs (total layoffs, companies affected, industries, workforce reduction %)  
- Top 10 industries by layoffs  
- Time-series trend of layoffs  
- Top layoff events  
- Layoff severity distribution pie chart  
- Interactive slicers (year, funding, industry, country)

**Files Included:**  
- `cleaning.sql` — data cleaning & transformation  
- `analysis.sql` — exploratory SQL analysis  
- `layoffs_clean_deduped.csv` — final cleaned dataset  
- `Global Tech Layoffs.pbix` — Power BI dashboard  
- `Global Tech Layoffs.pdf` — static dashboard view  
- `README.md` — full project documentation

## Canada Consumer Price Index (CPI) Analysis (2020–2025)
**Repository**  
[https://github.com/Esub-88/canada-cpi-2020-2025](https://github.com/Esub-88/Canadian-CPI-2021-2025)

**Tools Used:**  
- Python (pandas): data cleaning, wrangling, and feature engineering  
- SQL Server (T-SQL): YoY inflation calculations, category-level analysis  
- Power BI: interactive dashboard design, KPIs, bar/line visuals  
- GitHub: version control, documentation, reproducibility  

**Project Overview:**  
This end-to-end analytics project examines Canada’s CPI from 2020–2025, using federal inflation data to explore:  
- Post-COVID inflation surge (2021–2022)  
- Cooling period across 2023–2025  
- Category-level inflation volatility (gasoline, energy, food, shelter)  
- CPI Index movements using the Statistics Canada methodology (2002 = 100)  
- Year-over-year (YoY) inflation across 14 major consumer categories  

The dashboard includes:  
- KPI cards (latest YoY inflation, average surge inflation, average cooling inflation)  
- Full CPI Index line chart with markers identifying surge/cooling periods  
- Category-level inflation analysis using horizontal bar charts  
- Category slicer for filtering  

**Files Included:**  
- `cpi_cleaning.ipynb` — Python data cleaning & transformation  
- `analysis.sql` — SQL inflation modeling & YoY calculations  
- `CPI_over_time.csv`, `CPI_summary.csv` — cleaned datasets  
- `CPI Dashboard.pbix` — interactive Power BI dashboard  
- `CPI Dashboard.png` / `.pdf` — static dashboard export  
- `README.md` — full project documentation
